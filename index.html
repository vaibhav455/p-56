                Built by the famous Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan for its favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, the iconic structure of Taj Mahal, is the pride of India and more importantly, an epitome of love. Built as early as in the 16th century, Taj Mahal is the crown of India which is constructed purely of ivory-white marble and is best witnessed during sunrise.

                Located in the southwestern desert of Jordan, Petra is the world-famous archaeological site that once served as the Nabatean Kingdomâ€™s capital. Boasting of its one of a kind pink sandstone cliffs out of which the tombs and temples are sculpted, Al Khazneh is the most famous temple of all. Featuring a facade known as the Treasury, Petra reflects the authentic Greek architecture that attracts millions of travelers across the world.
